gegl command-line
-----------------

In addition to installing a library, GEGL also installs gegl - a
binary/program that permits doing image processing from the command-line
as well as an aid during development of GEGL operations. GEGL behaviour
can be modified at runtime by setting appropriate
link:environment.html[environment variables].

Some examples::
Render a composition to a PNG file, the composition can be in GEGLs XML
format or the one-liner friendly terser link:gegl-chain.html[gegl-chain]
format.

 $ gegl composition.xml -o composition.png
