gcut
====

GEGL video editing system
-------------------------

NOTE : gcut has been removed from the GEGL source tree, many parts of the
UI code that used to be part of gcut are now part of the Mrg (and lua) based
UI that the gegl binary can be optionally compiled with.


gcut is a video editing engine for link:http://gegl.org/[GEGL]. It permits
re-arranging bits of video with clean cuts and crossfades, as well as applying
filtering chains to individual clips or as global filters on top of the edited
video. At the moment gcut is primarily a data-model and file format, it can be
used to programatically generate video that are then rendered. There is also an
experimental user interface that can be used to augment and at some point
replace understanding gcuts text file syntax.

Features
--------

 - single-track editing, with cross fades
 - keeps source audio when editing
 - tuning of in/out points.
 - video audio correctly cut
 - shuffling of clips
 - background render processes rendering target-resolution cached frames.
 - proxy media support, permits editing with scaled down files for interactive speeds when editing workstation cannot deal with fullhd / 4k source footage at interactive speeds.
 - ui preview renderer using proxies - in separate thread for ui drawing/interaction; to keep it from blocking interaction.
 - drag and drop of media from desktop file managers
 - creating and editing per clip op-chains
 - interactive tuning scalar/string/boolean properties of ops
 - animating scalar properties of ops (only linear interpolation/key-framing for
now)
 - timestamped auto-save

Example output
--------------

The GEGL video from Libre Graphics Meeting 2016 in London,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJJPgLGrSgc was made from raw footage using
gcut, the default testproject of gcut which is in this repo as default.edl
produces the following video when rendered the first time (TODO: update this
video with newer render):

Graphical User Interface
------------------------

The UI is written using microraptor gui, using lightweight CSS styling for text
and cairo for drawing the interface direct from data structures.

The current UI is the minimal amount of UI needed for keyboard centered editing
with some mouse based scrubbing and positioning. The available keyboard actions
are different for the first and last frames of a clip compared with the
mid-clip frames, when jumping between clips with up/down arrows, one jumps
between the first frames of clips. The filter editing UI is not yet fully usful
for more than visualizing data created in a text-editor on the project file.

The basic view, with the F1 keyboard shortcut help overlaid over the video.

setting them through sliders. Slanted clip transitions indicates cross-fades.
Note that the current UI is the first attempt at a direct mapping of the file
format.

The amount of code, written in C is about equally divided 50/50 between the
core rendering logic in C and the UI, both about 3000 lines. All the actual
work and flexibility is provided by GEGL itself, new operations created for one
application become automatically available in possibly all of GIMP and
gnome-photos as they are added to GEGL the system.  Two ops in particular in
GEGL which trace their history back to a pre-GEGL 2004era video editor called
bauxite, [gegl:ff-load.h](http://gegl.org/operations/gegl-ff-load.html) and
[gegl:ff-save.h](http://gegl.org/operations/gegl-ff-save.html) which provide
the ability to load, decode, endcode and save GEGL buffers a video frames, and
associated audio - with playback and seeking oriented caching mechanisms. It
could be possible to add alternatives to these operations using for instance
gstreamer, and the rest of gcut would remain unchanged.

It is planned to, eventually, rewrite the UI part from C to lua, even if even
this C ui is very young, it will however use the same toolkit, cairo and
microraptor gui, aiming for shorter interaction cycles during development and
less fragile code and opening up for easier outside contributions, as well as
learning from mistakes and short comings in the UI prototype proof of concept
written in C, with mrg and cairo, anything that can be drawn can be made
interactive, thus at least editing animation curves could be made a lot more
visual and interactive.

File format
-----------

An example gcut edl file is as follows:

    output-path=result.mp4

    A.mp4 200 341
    A.mp4 514 732
    B.mp4 45 123

If this was stored in a file, test.edl we can run:

    $ gcut test.edl render

And gcut will put video and audio content belonging to times from frame no 200 to frame no 341, followed by frames from not 514 to 732 subsequently followed with frames 45-123 from another file B.mp4

if you just run:

    $ gcut test.edl

gcut will launch in UI mode, videos can be added by drag and drop from
file manager if starting out from scratch.

when quitting gcut will have overwritten the original file
with something like the following:

    output-path=example-output.mp4
    video-width=1920
    video-height=1080
    fps=59.940060
    frame-scale=1.293607
    t0=0.000000
    frame-no=311
    selection-start=216
    selection-end=216
    
    A.mp4 200 341
    A.mp4 514 732
    B.mp4 45 123

The output settings  for video-width, video-height and fps have been detected
from the first video clip - gcut works well if all clips have the same fps.

After each clip a gegl image processing chain following the format documented
at http://gegl.org/gegl-chain.html

One can for instance write:

    A.mp4 200 341 -- gaussian-blur std-dev-x=0.1rel std-dev-y=0.1rel gegl:threshold value=0.3

To blur and threshold A.mp4, this feature can be used for using arbitrary GEGL
pipelines with interpolated parameters as filters on a video clip. The suffix
rel used in the gaussian blur is dependant on the height of the video - this
permits the pipeline to be used for proxies as well as for full size video.

Values can also be animated by supplying them inside inside curly brackets,
containg keyframe=value pairs in a clip local interpolated time space {0=3.0
3=0.2 10=}. The format for the animated properties are likely to change as the
current place-holder linear only format is supplanted.

Entries without a path, but only a filtering part like:

-- 10.5s 20s  invert-gamma

would insert a chain of invert-gamma from 10.5s until 20s. These entries need
to be placed at the beginning of the file. (later, these filters will inherit
the position of the insertion cursor of the timeline.)

caching architecture
--------------------

The data storage model is central to gcuts architecture the user sees as a
project file contains the complete description of how to generate a video for a
sequence from source assets. The rest of objects used during processing can be
regenerated deterministically under the same hashed file names.

This file is broken down into a set of global assignments of key/values, and
lines describing clips with path - and filter overlays, with in/out points and
optional associated GEGL filter stacks.

gcut keeps cached data in the .gcut subdir in the same directory as the loaded
gcut project file, All the projects in a folder share the same .cache
directory. The cache data is separated in subdirs for ease of development and
debugging.

**.gcut/cache/**   contains the rendered frames - stored in files that are a hash
of a string containing , source clip/frame no and filter chain at given frame.
Thus making returns to previous settings reuse previous values. This folder can
be removed but all cached frames are lost - gcut should have a feature to
remove all non-cached frames.

**.gcut/history/**  contains undo snapshots of files being edited (backups from
frequent auto-save)

**.gcut/proxy/**  contains scaled down to for quick preview/editing video files

**.gcut/thumb/**  contains thumb tracks for video clips - thumb tracks are images
to show in the clips in the timeline, the thumb tracks are created using
iconographer from the proxy videos.

when the UI is running the following threads and processes exist:

**gcut project.edl**  mrg ui thread (cairo + gtk/raw fb) GEGL renderer/evaluation thread

**gcut project.edl cache 0 4**  background frame cache renderer processes

**gcut project.edl cache 1 4**  if frameno % 4 == 1 then this one considers

**gcut project.edl cache 2 4**  it its responsibility to render frameno, the

**gcut project.edl cache 3 4**  count of such processes is set to the number of cores/processors available.

The background renderer processes are stopped when playback is initiated, as
well as every 60 seconds, when a new set of caches (restarts to handle both
project file changes and possible memory leaks.)
